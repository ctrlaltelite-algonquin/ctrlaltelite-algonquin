                    <p>My dual focus on design and art allows me to maintain a cohesive vision across Project Zeus, ensuring that story elements and gameplay mechanics align with the world we’re building. By iterating on player feedback and refining level designs, I work to deliver a polished and compelling experience that reflects the team’s creativity and dedication.</p>
