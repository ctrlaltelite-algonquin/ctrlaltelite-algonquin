        <h1>PROJECT ZEUS</h1>
        <div class="panel-block-content">
            <p>After drifting in the void for 40 years, Rusty, an outdated maintenance droid, finally returns to the Astra Veritas, a once-thriving research and mining vessel. Decades of unchecked decay and corruption from Zeus—a mysterious, flesh-like substance created in secret experiments has twisted the station into a labyrinth of malfunctioning systems and horrifying creatures.</p>
            <p>Now, Rusty must navigate the wreckage, relying on his tools, adaptability, and determination to uncover what happened during his absence.</p>
