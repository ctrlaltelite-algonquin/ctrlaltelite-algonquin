Welcome to the first official development post for our capstone project, Project Zeus:
Legacy of the Astra Veritas! This week has been an exciting step forward as we
continue to refine and expand the demo level.

## Level Design & Environment
We've begun fully fleshing out the layout for the demo level, focusing on both gameplay
flow and environmental storytelling. This includes the placement of key interactable
elements, enemy encounters, and the overall atmosphere to ensure the station feels
immersive and alive.

## New Mini-Games
To add variety and engagement, we've started integrating additional mini-games. This
week, we've begun implementing Minesweeper-style mechanics, which will be used in
certain hacking and repair scenarios. These mini-games will offer players a challenge
beyond traditional combat and exploration, making Rusty’s maintenance duties more
interactive.

## Animation Planning
We're currently drafting an animation block-out list to ensure smooth movement and
interaction within the game world. This includes Rusty's locomotion, tool usage, and
enemy animations. Having a structured plan will allow us to efficiently animate
characters and objects, enhancing the overall polish of the game.

## Environmental Details & Posters
To enhance the visual storytelling and atmosphere, we've started working on decorative
posters and environmental details. These will provide both world-building elements and
subtle hints about the station's past, adding more depth and intrigue to the setting.
That’s all for this week! We’re excited to keep pushing forward and will have more
updates soon. Stay tuned for future dev blogs as Project Zeus continues to take shape!
